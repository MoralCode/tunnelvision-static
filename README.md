# TunnelVision (Static)

A reimplementation of TunnelVision as a statically-generated site.

## Tech Stack

Due to its use of Jinja2 templates and python base, Pelican seems like the best choice for static site generator here.




## Lineage

This project is another major fork and large re-do of the [CampusPulse Access Directory](https://github.com/CampusPulse/access-directory) project, which itself is a major fork and rewrite of the original Database-backed [TunnelVision](https://github.com/wilsonmcdade/tunnelvision) codebase.


## Licensing

At the point of forking, neither CampusPulse Access had a license formally defined. All original/new code added here is licensed AGPL by default. A license should be added eventually once theres a clearer idea of how much of the base TunnelVision and CampusPulse Access projects are being used.
